## Latent Scope

[Latent Scope](https://github.com/enjalot/latent-scope) is an open source library for embedding and visualizing unstructured text data. The library has it's own exploratory visualization tools, but it also makes it easy to export data for use in other workflows. This repo demonstrates visualizing the extracted data with regl-scatter and Observable Inputs.
