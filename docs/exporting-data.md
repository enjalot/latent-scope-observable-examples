# Exporting data

The goal of Latent Scope is to annotate your unstructured data with useful structured data. 
This guide will show you how to extract the data generated by Latent Scope and what it means.


## Download or Copy
Latent Scope is setup to store all of its data in flat files in the directory specified when you run `ls-serve`.
This means you can always access it from the file system of the computer where Latent Scope is running. 
If you've somehow forgotten where you set it up, you can go to the settings page: [https://localhost:5001/settings](https://localhost:5001/settings).

You can also get a nice listing in the UI of all the files for a given scope by visiting it's export page. 
If you followed the [Your First Scope]() tutorial you can see that here [https://localhost:5001/datavis-misunderstood/export/scopes-001](https://localhost:5001/datavis-misunderstood/export/scopes-001)
