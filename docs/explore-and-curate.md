title: Explore and Curate

# Explore
If you've [Installed & Configured](/install-and-config) Latent Scope and generated [Your first scope](/your-first-scope) you are ready to explore your data!

Being able to pull together your data into meaningful groups, whether its through automatic clustering, similarity search or selecting areas of the map

# Curate
A large motivation behind Latent Scope is not just to get a better view of your data, but to curate it in a way that would otherwise be far too manual and cumbersome. 

## Bulk Actions: Clusters
The automatically generated clusters are intended to give you a head-start, a way to start organizing your data. You may find that there are datapoints that belong to the wrong cluster, or require a new cluster all together. For this we have bulk actions.
