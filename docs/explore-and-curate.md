# Explore
If you've [Installed & Configured](install-and-config) Latent Scope and generated [Your first scope](your-first-scope) you are ready to explore your data!

The first thing you may notice is that you can interact with the map visualization on the left. You can pan and zoom.

You can hover over points to see their values, clicking and dragging will lasso select multiple points.

# Filters

The panel at the top right of the page provides a number of ways to filter your data.

## Similarity Search
You can do a nearest neighbors similarity search by embedding the search text with the same embedding model used to create your scope.

_You can optionally use any other embeddings you've created in the setup process, which may provide interesting insight into what different embedding models consider similar._







# Curate
A large motivation behind Latent Scope is not just to get a better view of your data, but to curate it in a way that would otherwise be far too manual and cumbersome. 

## Bulk Actions: Clusters
The automatically generated clusters are intended to give you a head-start, a way to start organizing your data. You may find that there are datapoints that belong to the wrong cluster, or require a new cluster all together. For this we have bulk actions.
